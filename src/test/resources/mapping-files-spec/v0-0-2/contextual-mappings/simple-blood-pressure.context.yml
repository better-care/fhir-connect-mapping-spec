# Instance/Context related mapping of concepts.

# In this case, a simple example mapping a wrapper template to a FHIR resource.

format: "0.0.2"   # Version of format, to catch invalid older iterations during quick early development. Will get stable at some point, of course.

  # List of archetypes contained in that template. A unique set of Archetypes must have only one unique instance mapping at max.
  # WIP Note: This could be calculated at runtime, but only with major implications on performance. In contrast, calculating at design time is a one-time single effort.
  archetypes:
    # This list could be computed by the (GUI) tooling, which will help to create these mappings.
