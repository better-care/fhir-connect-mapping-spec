# Listing of one bi-directional model mapping.

# General philosophy: The reading direction of those mappings is FHIR->openEHR, because
# openEHR is more descriptive, due to its "maximal modeling" approach. All ambiguities
# regarding the bi-directionality will be handled by the program/code.

mappings:
  # Each mapping has a unique (self documenting) name.

    # A simple mapping, which maps one attribute to another.

      # Some context variable are necessary to be accessible from the mapping.

  # Another mapping which maps on a met condition. This condition is used to identify
  # the correct "component" in the FHIR resource (array).

      # as "put those in the target resource" if the direction is openEHR->FHIR.

# The real mapping would continue to map:
# - performer
# - diastolic
# - clinical interpretation
# - body site
